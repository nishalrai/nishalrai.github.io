If someone is really interested in getting into cloud computing, there is a way to get free verification from a well-recognized cloud vendor.


# Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals can be a good place to start.

You must first register for the free virtual Azure Fundamental Training program.
 👇👇👇

Select a feasible date for the Azure Fundamental Training session.

After you’ve completed the virtual training session, Microsoft will send you a voucher for the Azure Fundamentals exam within 3–4 business days of the session’s completion.

But one still needs to pay $39 to schedule the AZ-900 exam by applying for the voucher.


But, I think 🤔 🤔 I addressed something called “free of cost” to get verified at the beginning.

So now, you just need to use the email account that you used to register for the virtual Azure Fundamental Training program and complete all the modules of the Azure Fundamentals track program.

The resources provided by Microsoft are all free and consist of quality content, sandbox labs, and quizzes.


After the completion of all the modules, only then should you schedule your AZ-900 exam using the provided link below:
